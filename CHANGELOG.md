### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Change

* Fix VSCode 1.72 [#45](https://github.com/KatsuteDev/Background/pull/45) ([@Katsute](https://github.com/Katsute))
  Installing backgrounds using this extension now causes VSCode to warn about the installation being corrupt üò≠. Select **Don't Show Again** to suppress this message.

### ‚≠ê New Features

* Use separate options depending on background type [#36](https://github.com/KatsuteDev/Background/pull/36) ([@Katsute](https://github.com/Katsute))
  ![configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KatsuteDev/Background/be20d9ec47892bdacf76c5b049b59a0279cf283c/assets/configuration.gif)

  * New configuration menu
  * Removed property specific commands
  * Background options are now separated based on UI type
  * Settings are now saved as arrays rather than objects. Values are in order of
    1. Window
    2. Editor
    3. Sidebar
    4. Panel
  * Fixed some validation issues

  If you do not like this separation of options you can restore the old behavior by using the new option `useWindowOptionsForAllBackgrounds` which will use the window options for all backgrounds. You still need to add background images separately.
